# This is the supplemental manifest file for AI application repositories. 
# Please update it fully, when your model is ready to step up in its lifecycle stage
# The entries in this manifest inform automated processes including:
# - model registration for compliance tracking
# - model review triggers
# - audit and administrative purposes
# if some of selection does not include your case, you have any question to the process, please raise a ticket via link below

# extension yamls will need to define a dependent direction on apps.
# eg for a library, the library doesn't know what uses it, but it knows what it is dependent on
# for a model, we have a requirement that the model knows where it is used, so it is the opposite direction of the library example
